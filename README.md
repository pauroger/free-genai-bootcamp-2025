# Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025

**GenAI Training and Hands-on Programming** This bootcamp provides hands-on
experience with Generative AI through real-world projects. The official course
site can be found [here]([https://genai.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/).

üöÄ Projects

1Ô∏è‚É£ Main course project: **Japanese Sentence Constructor**

This project aims to develop a chat agent that serves as a teaching assistant
for learning Japanese. The agent will help users translate English sentences
into Japanese by providing guidance rather than direct answers. The goal is to
enhance learning through active engagement and structured assistance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **German Writing Correction Assistant**

As a non-German speaker living in Zurich, I plan to integrate my GenAI learning
journey with improving my German writing skills. This project will follow the
same educational approach as the main course but will focus on German. I will
also adjust it to my current German level, which is low but not that of a
complete beginner.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

For both projects, I will leverage **ChatGPT-4o**, as I have a paid
subscription. The model will be fine-tuned to emphasize educational guidance
over direct problem-solving.

üìå Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with GenAI development.
- Build projects that promote active learning rather than passive consumption.

As the weeks progress, I may end up focusing on just one project.

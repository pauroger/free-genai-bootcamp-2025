## ðŸš€ Projects

### German Learning Portal

As a non-German speaker living in Zurich, I plan to integrate my GenAI learning
journey with improving my German writing skills. This project will follow the
same educational approach as the main course but will focus on German. I will
also adjust it to my current German level, which is low but not that of a
complete beginner.

ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with GenAI development.
- Build projects that promote active learning rather than passive consumption.

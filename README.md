# Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025

**GenAI Training and Hands-on Programming** This bootcamp provides hands-on
experience with Generative AI through real-world projects. The official course
site can be found [here]([https://genai.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/).

## 🚀 Projects

### German Learning Portal

As a non-German speaker living in Zurich, I plan to integrate my GenAI learning
journey with improving my German writing skills. This project will follow the
same educational approach as the main course but will focus on German. I will
also adjust it to my current German level, which is low but not that of a
complete beginner.

🛠️ Tech Stack

For both projects, I will leverage **ChatGPT-4o**, as I have a paid
subscription. The model will be fine-tuned to emphasize educational guidance
over direct problem-solving.

📌 Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with GenAI development.
- Build projects that promote active learning rather than passive consumption.
